					<p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
						I have spent the last 12 years in the fire service working as a
						professional firefighter & paramedic. I have always had a knack for
						technology and working with computers. In 2019 I started working
						with HTML & CSS to make some minor edits on a small business website
						that I was operating. What I thought was just a few small edits
						turned into a love for programming.
					</p>
					<p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
						Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn
						to learn more. I started learning javascript and was even more
						enthused with making websites interactive. I then started
						freelancing for e-commerce companies on the Shopify platform. I am
						now spending my time building projects with React JS, Firebase, and
						learning new technologies.
